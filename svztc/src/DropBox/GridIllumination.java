/**
 Grid Illumination: Given an NxN grid with an array of lamp coordinates.
 Each lamp provides illumination to every square on their x axis,
 every square on their y axis, and every square that lies in their diagonal
 (think of a Queen in chess).
 Given an array of query coordinates,
 determine whether that point is illuminated or not. The catch is when checking a query all lamps adjacent to, or on,â€¦
