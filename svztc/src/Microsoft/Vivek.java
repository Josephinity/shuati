 coding Question 1 - Find all the paths between two nodes

 Coding question 2 : Max sum in adjacent sub array

 Design Question - Design a ticketing System

 Design Question 2 - Design a system which allows multiple agents to read different data  from  same tables. Latency should be low.  Algorithm should rank agents through some logic and assigned work according to that so that each agents are reading different set  of rows from same table. Scale it for 20 million active agents .

 Follow up - If Data Sharding is allowed, what will be the Shard Id and how the partition will look like? How your system will respond if there are agents which are also writing at same time. Consistency should be given high preference over availability.
