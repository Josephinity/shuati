 1. Find the number of "10" in a stream of bytes. Define the input yourself.
    Given the pairwise distance of n points in a line, find locations of all the points. (You may assume the first point is at location 0).


 2. Given a 2D array, the cell value is the number of steps you may take to the next cell. If the current cell value is N,
 you may walk N steps towards one of the 4 directions up, down, left and right.
 Find out if one can walk from top-left to the bottom-right cell.
 Follow-up: How many steps at the minimum?


 3. Get the expression given the syntax tree. Possible operators include + - * /.
    Implement Zigzag Iterator.

 4. N players in a contest P1, P2, .. ,Pn, given a function bool canBeat(Pi, Pj) that tells you if Pi beats Pj in a match.
    Get the sequence with all players in it such that for any two adjacent players in the sequence, the former one must be able to beat the later one.
    Assume player 1 beats 2 ,  2 beats 3, 3 beats 4,   3 beats 1， 4 beats 1, one of the valid outputs is "1234"，
